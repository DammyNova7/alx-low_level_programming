# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

*During the course of this project, we were tasked to create user defined data types using structs and typedef. And I came up with the following solutions for each given task.*

* [dog.h](https://github.com/DammyNova7/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/dog.h)
* [1-init_dog]()
* [2-print_dog]()
> The task 3 had to do with the definition of a new type and is found in the [dog.h]() file.
* [4-new_dog]()
* [5-free_dog]()
